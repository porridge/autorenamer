The program is based on an example "iconview.py" program by Jan Bodnar, from
the PyGTK tutorial at http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pygtktutorial/
A copy of an email from Jan, clarifying the license, follows:

  Hi Marcin,
  
  Source code is BSD licensed. Which is the most convenient license I know.
  Which is in my words do what you want with the code; if you mention/link to the
  code you used it is fine, but even this is not required.
  
  What is licensed is the content, the tutorials. They cannot be republished
  on other sites without permission.
  
  Regards,
  
  Jan Bodnar
